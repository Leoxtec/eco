Changes/optimizations to existing code:

I.		Update control scheme, particularly for placing markers.

II.		Optimize marker generation.  Currently defining each marker as a seperate object.  Can instead define one marker 
		and use scaling and transformation for visible markers.  Although there is a tradeoff: current version uses more
		memory, suggested version will take more time.
	
III.	Update letters on directional axes.  Currently using more triangles than necessary, though the reduction won't be much.

IV.		Fix the window framing so that web page elements scale and/or don't change relative position.

V.		Texture PNG currently stored in client directory (javascript needs it that way to load it).  Need to figure out how to store and load
		to/from the database.
