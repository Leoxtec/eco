Once the "oct"-tree is in place, certain features will break and will need to be refactored.

I.  The mini-map will no longer work. 
	SUGGESTION:  Make a png of the map view during preprocessing of the "oct"-tree and render as a simple texture.
				 This will probably also require reworking some of the code that controls the position of the arrow
				 that indicates user position.
				 
II. Height calculation when placing a new marker will no longer work.
	SUGGESTION:  Write server side code that works with the stored "oct"-tree structure to determine height.
	
	
Other changes/optimizations to existing code:

I.	  Update control scheme, particularly for placing markers.

II.   Optimize marker generation.  Currently defining each marker as a seperate object.  Can instead define one marker 
	  and use scaling and transformation for visible markers.  Although there is a tradeoff: current version uses more
	  memory, suggested version will take more time.
	
III.  Update letters on directional axes.  Currently using more triangles than necessary, though the reduction won't be much.

IV.   Fix the window framing so that web page elements scale and/or don't change relative position.
